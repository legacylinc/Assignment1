# This is a simple Python program to demonstrate the use of variables, constants, and the print function.

# Variables
name = "Lincoln"     
age = 25             

# Constant 
PI = 3.14159

# Using the print function to display information
print("Hello, my name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old.")
print("The value of PI is:", PI)

# Doing a calculation with variables and constants
radius = 5
area = PI * (radius ** 2)   # formula: area of a circle = π * r²
print("The area of a circle with radius", radius, "is:", area)
